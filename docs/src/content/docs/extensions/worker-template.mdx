Worker Template Extension is a kind of lightweight extension running in web worker, 
following pre-defined template, making it easy to develop extension with consistent GUI.

## Installation

Run the project scaffolding command to create a new project with Worker Template Extension.

```bash
npm init kunkun --template template
```

## Development

```bash
npm run build # build the extension, generate dist/index.js file, this is the entry file of the extension, make sure it's listed in the package.json
npm run dev # start the development server, basically running rollup compile with watch mode
```

The `@kksh/api/dev` subpackage provides a `kununWorkerTemplateExtensionRollupPlugin` function.
This is a rollup plugin used to hot reload the extension in development mode. 

In dev mode (`npm run dev`), every time you save the file, the extension will be recompiled and Kunkun desktop app will be notified to reload the extension.
Otherwise you need to manually reload the extension.

The template should come with the `kununWorkerTemplateExtensionRollupPlugin` plugin already configured in the rollup config file.
