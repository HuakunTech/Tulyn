Custom UI command is just a web app. You can use any front-end framework (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc) to build arbitrarily complex UI,
as long as it can be built into static files (e.g. SSG, CSR, but not SSR).

For example, you can create a transparent window with a 3D model floating on your screen.

Here is an example of KK's git-skyline extension,

<div class="not-content h-64">
	<iframe
		src="https://git-skyline.huakun.tech/contribution/github/huakunshen/embed"
		class="h-full w-full"
	/>
</div>

KK provides multiple scaffolding templates to help you get started with your extension development.

Supported templates:

- React
- Next.js
- Vue
- Nuxt.js
- Svelte
- SvelteKit

## Installation

```bash
npm init kunkun@latest  # choose a template
```

After creating a template project, you need to edit `package.json`.

You don't have to use the template provided, you can always start from scratch with `pnpm create vite`.

You can also convert an existing web app into a KK extension by adding `kunkun` config to `package.json`.

## Development

### Change Dev Extension Path

import ChangeDevExtPath from "./snippets/change-dev-ext-path.mdx"

<ChangeDevExtPath />

### Edit Manifest

KK uses `package.json` to define an extension.

See [Manifest](/developer/manifest/) for more details.

You need to edit the name, description, identifier and icon of your extension.

:::danger
Make sure the identifier is the same as the extension folder name.

KK uses the identifier to find the extension folder.

If they are not the same, the extension will not be published.

#### `customUiCmds`

**Sample Config**

```json title="package.json"
"kunkun": {
  ...
  "customUiCmds": [
    {
      "main": "/",
      "dist": "build",
      "devMain": "http://localhost:5173/dev-extensions/template-ext-sveltekit/build",
      "name": "Sveltekit Template Home Page",
      "cmds": []
    },
    {
      "main": "about",
      "dist": "build",
      "devMain": "http://localhost:5173/dev-extensions/template-ext-sveltekit/build/about",
      "name": "Sveltekit Template About Page",
      "cmds": []
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

- `dist` is the build output folder.
  - For Vite, it is `dist`.
  - For SvelteKit, it is `build`.
  - For Next.js, it is `out`.
- `devMain` is the development server URL.
- `name` is the name of the command.

#### Permissions

KK provides many APIs within `@kksh/api` package. See [API Docs](/developer/api/api/) for more details.

Most of them requires adding corresponding permissions in `package.json`.

For example, if you want to read clipboard text, you need to add `clipboard:read-text` permission in `package.json`, under `kunkun.permissions` field.

See [Extension Permissions](/extensions/security/permissions/) for a full list of permissions, and API docs for each API to see how to add permissions.

Some permissions are just a single string, some are scoped permissions.

### Configure Base Path

Unfortunately, due to a limitation of Tauri's API, KK requires the base url for a web app to be set.
The default base url "/" won't work. This may be solved in the future.

1. Extension identifier in `package.json` must be the same as folder name
2. `dist` is the build output folder, this should also be set in `package.json` for each custom ui command
3. Base Url should be set to `${identifier}/${dist}`

For example,

- an react extension called `my-react-ext`, with build folder `dist`, the base url should be `/my-react-ext/dist`.
- an sveltekit extension called `my-sveltekit-ext`, with build folder `build`, the base url should be `/my-sveltekit-ext/build`.

Here are some sample configurations:

import { TabItem, Tabs } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Vite">
  The base url config for vite projects should be the same no matter what framework you choose.
  Here I use react as an example.

### Start Coding

It is recommended to use `pnpm` for development because when the extension is built in our CI, it is also built with pnpm.

Developing custom command is the same as developing a web app, HMR is supported.

#### Load Mode

Each custom UI command can have a `devMain` URL. This is the URL of the development server.

To enable dev mode, toggle setting: `Settings -> General -> Dev Extension Load Mode` to `Development Mode`.

When dev mode is enabled, you should see `Live` badge beside the extension commands in KK, and KK will load the `devMain` URL from your development server.

When mode is `Production Mode`, KK loads built extension from `main` field in `package.json`.

For example, given the config above, it loads `build/index.html` and `build/about.html`.

#### Helper Buttons

Custom command by default injects some buttons (back button, move button and refresh button) on top of your extension.

They are useful when your extension is not ready yet. Without these buttons, you may not be able to navigate back to the main menu or move the app window.

See [Iframe UI API](/developer/api/ui/iframe/), for how to move or hide these buttons.

#### Theme

The scaffolded project uses `@kksh/react` or `@kksh/vue` or `@kksh/svelte` as the UI component library.

When these libraries, you can easily keep your extensions' theme consistent with KK.

import UpdateUiTheme from "../developer/API/ui/snippets/update-ui-theme.mdx"

<UpdateUiTheme />

#### Window Customization

Under `uiCmds` field, each UI command can have custom window style. All Tauri window styles are supported.
You can read more in Tauri's documentation. The attributes are passed to `WebviewWindow` class from Tauri to create a Window.

Go to [Developer/Manifest Doc](/developer/manifest/) to see all avaialble window styles with intellisense in the code playground.
In `Sample Package JSON`, in a UI Command, type double quote in a window object. Then intellisense will display all available window styles.

```json
...
    "customUiCmds": [
        "window": {
          "titleBarStyle": "overlay"
        },
        ...
    ]
...
```

## Advanced Usage

Although I previously mentioned that KK supports any SSG/CSR web apps as extensions,
this doesn't mean you can't run a web server in the extension.

If you request shell permission in the manifest file, you can run a web server process in the
extension (e.g. with Node, Bun, Deno runtime if installed locally, [read more about runtime](/extensions/runtime))
and communicate with the frontend. You can then implement pretty much anything you want.
