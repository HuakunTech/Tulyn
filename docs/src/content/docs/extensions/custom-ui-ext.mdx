## Advanced Usage

Although I previously mentioned that KK supports any SSG/CSR web apps as extensions, 
this doesn't mean you can't run a web server in the extension.

If you request shell permission in the manifest file, you can run a web server process in the 
extension (e.g. with Node, Bun, Deno runtime if installed locally, [read more about runtime](/extensions/runtime)) 
and communicate with the frontend. You can then implement pretty much anything you want.
