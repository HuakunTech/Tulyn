There are two types of extensions for now:

1. Template UI Extension
2. Custom UI Extension

## Template UI Extension

[Template UI Extension](./worker-template) is a kind of lightweight extension running in web worker, 
following pre-defined template, making it easy to develop extension with consistent GUI.

> Choose this if you don't need complex UI. List view is provided. 
> You can write vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript code to build GUI for extensions.

## Custom UI Extension

[Custom UI Extension](./custom-ui-ext) is basically a web app. Kunkun is essentially running in a web browser. 
Any web app can be loaded as an extension. You can use any front-end framework to build the UI (React, Vue, Angular, SvelteComponent, etc).

> Choose this if you need complex UI. You can build any UI you want. Even transparent window is supported.

Any CSR/SSG web apps are directly supported. Existing web apps can be easily converted into Kunkun extensions 
by adding manifest file only.
