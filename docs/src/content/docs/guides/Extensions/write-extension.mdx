:::note
Kunkun is designed to be extensible like VSCode, Raycast, and Alfred. You can write your own extensions to extend Kunkun's functionality, making it highly customizable. Each extension is a lightweight applet written in JavaScript using web technologies, which can be developed with virtually any framework (React, Vue, Svelte) as long as it can be generated as a static website. This allows for complex UI designs without any restrictions.
:::

> This guide only talks about how to write an extension. To learn more about the design and security model , see [Extensions Doc](/extensions)**.**

https://github.com/HuakunTech/KunkunExtensions is the repository containing all extensions for KK.

Under the `extension-template` you can grab a template to start your own extension.

:::tip
I will make a video tutorial to demonstrate how to write an extension once the development process is stable.

## Steps

### Init Project

If you want to add the extension to the extension store, you can fork https://github.com/HuakunTech/kunkunExtensions and add your extension to the `extensions` directory.

Otherwise, just create a new project.

Pick any web framework you like. You can grab a template from https://github.com/HuakunTech/KunkunExtensions.

Open `package.json` in root and and the `$schema` field to the top of the file.

Add `kunkun` field to the `package.json` to specify the extension name, identifier, short description, long description, etc.

```json title="package.json"
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.kunkun.sh",
    "kunkun": {
        "name": "JWT Inspector",
        "shortDescription": "JWT Inspector",
        "longDescription": "JWT Inspector",
        "identifier": "sh.kunkun-jwt-inspector",
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

VSCode should provide intellisense for the fields in the manifest file. Missing fields and wrong data types will be highlighted.

Any existing web app can be converted to a Kunkun extension, by adding the `kunkun` field to the `package.json`.

### Install API

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Use `pnpm` if you are adding to `KunkunExtensions` repo as it uses `pnpm` workspace.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @kksh/api
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @kksh/api
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Declare Permissions

Declare permissions in `package.json` to access system APIs.

Only declared permissions can be accessed. This is to protect user's privacy.

```json title="package.json"
{
    ...
    "kunkun": {
        ...
        "permissions": [
            "clipboard:read-text",
            "clipboard:write-all",
            "fs:read-dir"
        ]
    }
}
```

See [Extension Permission Doc](/extensions/permissions/) for a list of all permissions and their descriptions.

### Develop

It is just a web app. System APIs can be accessed through `@kksh/api/ui`.

```ts
import { clipboard, fs, dialog, notification } from '@kksh/api/ui/worker';

const text = await clipboard.readText();
```

See [Developer/API](/developer/api/) for more information.

Start dev server

```bash
pnpm dev # suppose dev server started on port 5173
```

The web app can be accessed at http://localhost:5173.

Under Settings/Developer/Installation, set Dev Extension Path to the directory containing all extensions.


import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

If you are using the `KunkunExtensions` repo, set it to `KunkunExtensions/extensions`.

<FileTree>
- KunkunExtensions
  - extensions
    - ext-qrcode
      - package.json
      - dist
    - ext-jwt
      - package.json
      - dist
</FileTree>

Now go back to the main search in home page, you should see the extension loaded. Dev extensions should have a <span class="bg-green-600 px-1 dark:text-black text-white font-bold rounded-sm">DEV</span> tag.

But selecting your dev extension command won't work yet. By default, KK loads the `main` field in `package.json` `kunkun` settings.

For the following example, KK tries to load `dist/index.html`. So you have to run `npm run build` to generate the `dist` directory first before you can load the command.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.kunkun.sh
",
  "name": "jarvis-ext-jwt",
  "description": "JWT Inspector",
  "kunkun": {
    "name": "Hacker News",
    "identifier": "sh.kunkun.hacker-news",
    "shortDescription": "List latest top hacker news",
    "icon": {
      "type": "iconify",
      "value": "fa:hacker-news"
    },
    "longDescription": "",
    "demoImages": [],
    "permissions": [
      "shell:open"
    ],
    "templateUiCmds": [
      {
        "name": "Hacker News",
        "main": "dist/index.js",
        "description": "Read the latest Hacker News stories",
        "cmds": []
      }
    ],
    "customUiCmds": []
  },
  "files": ["dist"]
  ...
}
```

More details at [Extension Manifest Validator](/developer/manifest/).

#### Hot Reload

It's annoying to run `npm run build` every time you make a change. 

Go to settings page, under general tab, enable `Dev Extension URL`.

Now, KK will load the `devMain` URL installed of `main`.

#### Window Customization

Under `uiCmds` field, each UI command can have custom window style. All Tauri window styles are supported.
You can read more in Tauri's documentation. The attributes are passed to `WebviewWindow` class from Tauri to create a Window.

Go to [Developer/Manifest Doc](/developer/manifest/) to see all avaialble window styles with intellisense in the code playground.
In `Sample Package JSON`, in a UI Command, type double quote in a window object. Then intellisense will display all available window styles.


```json
...
    "customUiCmds": [
        "window": {
          "titleBarStyle": "overlay"
        },
        ...
    ]
...
```

### Verify Extension

After the extension is ready, you need to pack it and verify that it can be loaded in KK.

1. Disable `Dev Extension URL` in settings, general tab.
2. Run `npm run build` to generate the `dist` directory.
3. Try to load the dev extension in KK, i.e. Search for your dev extension and select it to see if the UI can be loaded.
4. Make sure `files` field in `package.json` only includes necessary files. e.g. `"files": ["dist"]`.
5. Run `npm pack` to generate a tarball file.
    - Decompress the tarball file to see if only necessary files are included.
6. Go to settings page, developer tab, drag and drop the tarball file to install the extension.
    - The tarball file is decompressed to the dev extension path.
    - You may want to change the dev extension path as the new extension will be installed in the dev extension path as well, where your dev project is. And 2 extensions with the same identifier will be loaded.
    - The new extension's folder name will be the identifier, so it shouldn't override existing extensions.
7. Check to see if the extension UI can be loaded in KK.
8. Run validation script if you are adding to `KunkunExtensions` repo.

    <FileTree>
    - KunkunExtensions
      - ci
        - validate.ts
      - extensions
        - ext-qrcode
          - package.json
          - dist
        - ext-jwt
          - package.json
          - dist
    </FileTree>


    ```bash
    pnpm install # install dependencies for the KunkunExtensions monorepo
    pnpm clean # clean all extensions, remove all `.tgz` files
    cd ci
    bun validate.ts # I use bun to directly run TypeScript file
    ```

    The `validate.ts` runs a `checkPackagesValidity()` function to load all extensions under `extensions` folder and check if they are valid.

    Checks include:
    1. `package.json` exsists and is valid JSON
    2. `package.json` follows the schema
    3. No `identifier` conflict

    If you have docker installed, you can add one line to the bottom `validate.ts` to build your extension with docker. 
    This is to make sure the extension can be built in our CICD environment.

    ```ts
    buildWithDockerAndValidate(join(extensionsDir, "<extension folder name>"));
    ```

## Publish

For now, KK doesn't have a website like Raycast for extensions. 

You can send a PR to [`KunkunExtensions`](https://github.com/HuakunTech/kunkunExtensions) repo to add your extension. 

Once your PR is merged, your extension will be compiled in a isolated environment with docker and uploaded to the store.

## Notes

- Any web frameworks can be used to develop extensions. e.g. React, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla JS.
- To keep your UI consistent with KK, it is recommended to use Shadcn
  - Shadcn is a beautiful and customizable tailwind library.
  - They reason I choose it is because
    - I love using Tailwind
    - Shadcn is avaialble in React (https://ui.shadcn.com/), Vue (https://shadcn-vue.com/), Svelte (https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/), 
      this helps keeping the UI consistent across different frameworks.
- The KK desktop app is built with Astro + Vue + Shadcn-Vue + Element Plus.
  - If you use Vue, you can also add Element Plus to your stack. Shadcn doesn't have good toast component. I mainly use Element Plus for notifications.
- Follow the manifest schema in `package.json`, otherwise your extension will not be loaded. See [Extension Manifest Validator](/developer/manifest/).
- Before packing your extension, make sure only necessary files are included in `files` field in `package.json`. This is to reduce the size of the extension.
  - For example, if `dist` is the output directory of your build, you can set `"files": ["dist"]` in `package.json`.
- Make sure only the necessary permissions are declared.
