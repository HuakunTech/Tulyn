title: Fetch

**Docs:** https://docs.api.kunkun.sh/interfaces/ui.IFetch

Fetch API is the same for both iframe and web worker environment.

When you use the built-in `fetch` or http client like Axios directly in iframe or web worker, 
you may encounter CORS issue.

`fetch()` API provided in `@kksh/api` sends the request through the host app, thus bypassing CORS.

`'fetch:all'` permission is required to use this API.

The syntax is pretty much the same as browser's built-in `fetch()` API.

```ts
import { fetch } from '@kksh/api/ui/worker';
// or
import { fetch } from '@kksh/api/ui/iframe';

await fetch('https://schema.kunkun.sh')
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => {});
```
