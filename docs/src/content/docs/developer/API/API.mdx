[Jarvis API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jarvis-api) is an NPM package designed for developers to create extensions for Jarvis.
It provides a set of APIs to interact with Jarvis and access system resources.

For example,

- Clipboard API: read and write clipboard
- System API: get system information
- Shell API: run shell command
- File System API: access file system
- Notification API: show notification
- Dialog API: show dialog, interact with user
- etc.

See [API Reference](http://localhost:4321/api-docs) for more details.


## UI Extension API

For now, only `jarvis-api/ui` is useful. This subpackage is designed for UI extension commands (open extension in a new window).

Other types of extensions are not supported yet, so you don't need to use APIs exposed in `jarvis-api`.

Some APIs are simply re-export of Tauri APIs. You can refer to Tauri's documentation as well. 

In code editor, you can type a function call and check the doc string to see the usage. 
The API documentation generated by TypeDoc doesn't include the re-exported APIs from Tauri, using IntelliSense in code editor is easier.

## Playground

Here is a code editor playground with `jarvis-api` installed. You can try out the API.
But don't try to run it, as the API is not designed to run in the browser.
