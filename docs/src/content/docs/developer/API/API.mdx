### Acknowledgement

A lot of the APIs provided in `@kksh/api` are alias of Tauri's official APIs, or inspired by Tauri's APIs.
:::


[Kunkun API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kksh/api) is an NPM package designed for developers to create extensions for KK.
It provides a set of APIs to interact with KK and access system resources.

For now, there are 2 environments to run the extension: web worker and iframe. 
They are not completely the same, so I made separate subpackages for them for clarity and make tree-shaking easier.

The APIs are exposed in the following subpackages:

- `@kksh/api/ui/iframe`
- `@kksh/api/ui/worker`

The `ui` subpackage means they are designed for UI extensions (i.e. extension has GUI). 
This is to distinguish from "headless" extensions for non-UI extensions (which I plan to develop in the future).

See [API Reference](/api-docs) for more details.

https://docs.api.kunkun.sh/ is the generated API documentation with a full list of APIs and their type definitions.

Most APIs are the same, I will document the differences between them in the API reference.

## Playground

Here is a code editor playground with `@kksh/api` installed. You can try out the API.
But don't try to run it, as the API is not designed to run in the browser.

The sample code here is only for template extensions running in web worker environment. 

APIs are imported from `@kksh/api/ui/worker`. 
The custom UI extension running in iframe have slightly different APIs.

The playground is only to give you a taste of how the API works and what kind of APIs are available.
For more details and example, please keep read the following pages.
