:::caution
Kunkun is still in early development, the extension schema is not finalized yet, and could change any time.

I will try to make the schema as stable as possible, and be backward compatible. But there is no guarantee in the current stage.

To get the latest schema for nightly build: `https://extensions.jarvis.huakun.tech/nightly.schema.json`
:::

Kunkun extensions metadata is defined in `package.json`.

In order to facilitate the validation of the extension manifest, I provide some tools that can be used to validate the manifest file.

## Json Schema

In the `package.json` of your extension, you can add a `$schema` field. In VSCode,
this will enable intellisense for the fields in the manifest file.
Missing fields and wrong data types will be highlighted.

```json title="package.json"
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.kunkun.sh
",
    ...
}
```

If you don't want to include this in your `package.json`, you can also configure VSCode workspace setting

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["<path to extension>/package.json"],
      "url": "https://schema.kunkun.sh
"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Playground

Here are two playgrounds with schema enabled. You can validate your extension manifest.

### Sample Package JSON

Try removing the `description` field or change `jarvis` to `jarvis2`. Error messages will be shown below.

import ManifestValidator from "../../../components/ManifestValidator.tsx";

<div className="not-content">
  <ManifestValidator client:only="react" />
</div>
